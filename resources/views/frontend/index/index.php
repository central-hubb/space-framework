        <p>
            The Space MVC PHP Framework is the fastest and most lightweight high performance, scalable, advanced PHP    7+ framework available.
            Born from the best ideas of other popular and mainstream frameworks, with a fresh start built from the ground up to perform record breaking performance benchmarks!
            (This framework runs 4x faster than laravel and uses 10x less cpu processing than symfony)

                If you are new to the Space MVC framework then the best way to see what it's all about is to read
                through our Documentation and have a look at our Screencasts.

                Any open-source project, especially a framework, requires great documentation and many have failed to
                achieve this. We feel that our documentation covers the API (Classes, Methods, etc) and we have a few
                guides but there can always be more. If you'd like to help us contribute then please write up anything
                you learn as a guide and submit it to us.

            <h2>Features</h2>
            <p>Space is a MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework that was designed from the ground up to have full
                support for HMVC as part of its architecture. But we didn't stop there, we also added ViewModels
                (also known as presentation models) into the mix which give you the option to add a powerful layer
                between the Controller and the View.

                Space also supports a more router based approach where you might route directly to a closure which
                deals with the input uri, making the closure the controller and giving it control of further execution.
