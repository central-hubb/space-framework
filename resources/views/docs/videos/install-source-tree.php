<h1>What is Git?</h1>

<p>
	By far, the most widely used modern development code backup and history version control system in the world today is Git. Git is a mature, actively
	maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux
	operating system kernel. A staggering number of software projects rely on Git for version control, including
	commercial projects as well as open source. Developers who have worked with Git are well represented in the
	pool of available software development talent and it works well on a wide range of operating systems and IDEs
	(Integrated Development Environments).
</p>

<p>In short Git is used to backup a copy of your website code online in its original source code state. You can setup git
	to use private repositories or public repositories to store you data.
    You can also allow multiple developers to work from your github repositories (project backups).
</p>

<p>A Private repository will allow for only users you choose to download and develop on your code</p>
<p>A Public Repository will allow the general public to view and download your code</p>
<p>The main benefit of using git is that multiple developers can work on the same project at the same time and they will pull and push code to and from git</p>
<p>Git acts as a centralized location for your code so you can develop as a team more easily</p>

<h1>What is source tree?</h1>

<p>
    In general when using the default git commands this is usually done via the command line or terminal,
    yet this can be harder to learn for first time users. There programs such as source tree available which offer a
    graphical user interface to make git easier to use.
