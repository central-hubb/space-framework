<h1>What is an Code Development IDE?</h1>

<p>
	An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software suite that consolidates basic tools required to write and test software.
</p>

<p>
	Developers use numerous tools throughout software code creation, building and testing. Development tools often include text editors, code libraries, compilers and test platforms. Without an IDE, a developer must select, deploy, integrate and manage all of these tools separately. An IDE brings many of those development-related tools together as a single framework, application or service. The integrated toolset is designed to simplify software development and can identify and minimize coding mistakes and typos.
</p>

<p>
	Integrated development environments are designed to maximize programmer productivity by providing tight-knit components with similar user interfaces.
	IDEs present a single program in which all development is done. This program typically provides many features for authoring, modifying, compiling, deploying and debugging software.

	Some IDEs are dedicated to a specific programming language, allowing a feature set that most closely matches the programming paradigms of the language. However, there are many multiple-language IDEs.
