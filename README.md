### The most Lightweight PHP MVC Framework

The Space MVC PHP Framework is the fastest and most lightweight high performance, scalable, advanced PHP 7+ framework 
available. Born from the best ideas of other popular and mainstream frameworks, with a fresh start built from the ground 
up to perform record breaking performance benchmarks! (This framework runs 4x faster than laravel and uses 10x less cpu 
processing than symfony)

## About Space MVC Framework

Space MVC is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Space MVC attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine].
- [Powerful dependency injection container].
- Multiple back-ends for [session] and [cache] storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM].
- Database agnostic [schema migrations].
- [Robust background job processing].
- [Real-time event broadcasting].

Space MVC is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications.
